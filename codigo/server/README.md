# I&N Kids Server

Project created with the aim of being used alongside I&N Kids' front-end, serving as a connection between the application interface and the database.

## üî® Project functionality

The main function of this API is to fetch the data entered on the I&N Kids front-end and save it to MongoDB. In addition to performing the main CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions, this application is also responsible for validating whether the data filled in by the website users is correct before storing it in the database, thus ensuring greater security of this data.
